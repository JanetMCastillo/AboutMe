          <h2> A Little About Me </h2>
        </header>
          <hr>
          <p> Want to know a little about me? Well, you've come to the right place. My name is Janet C. and I am a student at Thinkful. I'm part of the part-time Software engineering Flex Program based out of Goodyear, AZ. Don't know where that is? Check out the map below.</p>
        <p>I am still exploring all there is to know about coding and creating great content. I currently work full time as a Human Resources Specialist at a community college. I hope to dive deep into a software engineering career as soon as I finish my program.</p>

          <h2>My Coding Journey</h2>
          <hr>
        </header>
        <p> My coding experince is quite brief as I am still learning the ins and outs of everything but I've loved my experince with the complexity of the code. Problem solving is MY JAM. I get help from my mentor and from my brother-in-law, who is also in the field.</p>
        <p>I dont get much free-time but when I do some of my interests outside of coding include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Roller-skating</li>
              <li>Netflix-Binging</li>
              <li>Foodie </li>
            </ul>
